# JIRA Bidirectional Linking - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Missing

You correctly identified that the `link_jira` operation was only updating the local project.json but NOT updating the JIRA epic. This meant:
- ✅ You could find JIRA from project
- ❌ You couldn't find project from JIRA

## What I Implemented

### 1. New Function: `updateJiraIssueLabels`
Added to `src/tools/jiraTools.ts`:
- Fetches current labels from JIRA issue
- Adds new labels while preserving existing ones
- Updates the issue via JIRA API

### 2. Enhanced `link_jira` Action
Updated `src/tools/project/unifiedProject.ts`:
- Now calls `updateJiraIssueLabels` when linking
- Adds label format: `project-{projectId}`
- Handles errors gracefully (local link still works if JIRA fails)

## How It Works Now

When you run:
```bash
project link_jira --projectId "localization_20250531_031122_709" --jiraProjectKey "TT-206"
```

**Two things happen:**

1. **Local Update** (as before):
   - project.json gets the JIRA epic info

2. **JIRA Update** (NEW!):
   - Epic TT-206 gets labeled with `project-localization_20250531_031122_709`

## Finding Projects from JIRA

In JIRA, you can now:

### See the Label
Look at the epic's labels section - you'll see:
- `project-localization_20250531_031122_709`

### Search with JQL
Find all MCP-linked epics:
```
labels ~ "project-*"
```

Find a specific project's epic:
```
labels = "project-localization_20250531_031122_709"
```

## Benefits

1. **True Bidirectional Linking**: Find connections from both directions
2. **JIRA Native**: Uses standard JIRA labels, visible in UI
3. **Searchable**: JQL queries work perfectly
4. **Resilient**: Local link works even if JIRA API fails
5. **No Data Loss**: Preserves existing labels on the epic

## Error Handling

If JIRA API fails:
- Local link is still created ✅
- Warning is logged to console
- You can manually add the label later
- The response tells you what happened

## Next Steps

With bidirectional linking in place, you can now build:
- Auto-fetch child tasks when opening project
- Sync task status between systems
- Continuous mode to work through epic tasks
- Bulk operations across linked items

The foundation for advanced JIRA integration is now complete!
