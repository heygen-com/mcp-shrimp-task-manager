# Memory Tool Consolidation

## Overview

We've successfully consolidated all individual memory tools into a single unified tool called `memories`, following the same pattern as the `project` tool.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified Memory Tool
- **File**: `src/tools/memory/unifiedMemory.ts`
- **Actions**: 
  - `record` - Record a new memory
  - `query` - Query memories with filters
  - `update` - Update an existing memory
  - `delete` - Delete a memory
  - `maintenance` - Perform maintenance (archive old, decay scores, get stats)
  - `get_chain` - Get related memory chains
  - `consolidate` - Consolidate duplicate memories
  - `analytics` - Generate memory analytics
  - `export` - Export memories to file
  - `import` - Import memories from file

### 2. Updated Tool Registration
- **File**: `src/index.ts`
- Replaced individual memory tools with unified `memories` tool
- Removed translation tools from agent access:
  - `translate_content`
  - `retranslate_i18n`
  - `consolidate_translation_memory`

### 3. Previous Tool Names (Now Deprecated)
The following tools have been replaced by the unified `memories` tool:
- `record_memory` → `memories` with `action: "record"`
- `query_memory` → `memories` with `action: "query"`
- `update_memory` → `memories` with `action: "update"`
- `delete_memory` → `memories` with `action: "delete"`
- `memory_maintenance` → `memories` with `action: "maintenance"`
- `get_memory_chain` → `memories` with `action: "get_chain"`
- `consolidate_memories` → `memories` with `action: "consolidate"`
- `memory_analytics` → `memories` with `action: "analytics"`
- `export_memories` → `memories` with `action: "export"`
- `import_memories` → `memories` with `action: "import"`

## Usage Examples

### Recording a Memory
```json
{
  "action": "record",
  "content": "Discovered that using timestamp-based IDs improves project organization",
  "summary": "Timestamp IDs improve organization",
  "type": "breakthrough",
  "tags": ["best-practices", "project-management"],
  "projectId": "project_123"
}
```

### Querying Memories
```json
{
  "action": "query",
  "searchText": "localization",
  "filters": {
    "types": ["decision", "breakthrough"],
    "projectId": "localization_project"
  },
  "sortBy": "relevance",
  "limit": 10
}
```

### Memory Maintenance
```json
{
  "action": "maintenance",
  "operation": "archive_old",
  "daysOld": 90
}
```

## Translation Tools Status
The translation tools have been removed from agent access but the code remains in the codebase for future rebuilding:
- Code still exists in `src/tools/translation/`
- Not registered in the tool list
- Can be rebuilt and re-enabled in the future
