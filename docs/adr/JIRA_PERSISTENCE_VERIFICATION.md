# JIRA Linking Persistence - Verification Report

## ✅ The JIRA linking IS working correctly!

I've verified that the JIRA epic information is properly persisted to the `project.json` file. Here's proof:

### Test Results

I created and ran a test that:
1. Created a new project
2. Linked it to a JIRA epic
3. Verified the data was saved to `project.json`
4. Opened the project to confirm JIRA info is displayed

**Result**: All tests passed! ✅

### Where JIRA Info is Stored

The JIRA information is saved in:
```
data/projects/{project_id}/project.json
```

Example from the test:
```json
{
  "id": "jira_persistence_test_20250531_032958_806",
  "name": "JIRA Persistence Test",
  "externalTracker": {
    "type": "jira",
    "issueKey": "TEST-123",
    "issueType": "epic",
    "url": "https://example.atlassian.net/browse/TEST-123"
  }
}
```

### When You Open a Project

The JIRA information appears in the project summary:
```
### External Tracker
- **Type**: JIRA
- **Issue**: TEST-123 (epic)
- **URL**: https://example.atlassian.net/browse/TEST-123
```

## Why It Might Have Seemed Not to Work

If you didn't see the JIRA info persisting, it could be because:

1. **The linking failed** - Check if you got an error message when running `link_jira`
2. **Wrong project ID** - Make sure you're opening the same project you linked
3. **JIRA API issues** - The epic creation might have failed

## Auto-Fetch Feature (Your Request)

You mentioned wanting to "auto fetch some tasks" when opening a project. This is a great idea! Here's what we can add:

### Current State
- JIRA epic info is saved ✅
- Epic is displayed when opening project ✅
- Tasks are NOT auto-fetched yet ❌

### Proposed Enhancement
When opening a project with JIRA integration, automatically:
1. Fetch all tasks under the epic
2. Display task summary (To Do, In Progress, Done)
3. Cache the results for offline access
4. Offer to sync with local tasks

### Next Steps to Implement
1. Add `fetchEpicTasks` function to fetch child issues
2. Modify project open to include JIRA tasks
3. Add caching to avoid excessive API calls

Would you like me to implement the auto-fetch feature now?
