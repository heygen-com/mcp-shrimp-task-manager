# JIRA Epic Integration - Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

I've successfully implemented the two-phase JIRA epic creation flow as requested. Here's what was built:

### Key Changes

1. **Modified Project Creation Flow**
   - Projects are now created locally first without JIRA integration
   - Removed automatic JIRA prompts during creation
   - Added guidance for users who want JIRA integration

2. **New Actions Added**
   - `project list_jira_projects` - Lists all available JIRA projects
   - `project link_jira` - Creates epic and links to existing project

3. **Enhanced JIRA Tool**
   - Added support for listing JIRA projects
   - Added epic creation capability (not just tasks)
   - Extended schema to support `issueType` parameter

### Usage Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Create local project
project create --name "Translation System" --description "i18n support"
# → Creates project with ID: translation_system_20241223_abc123

# Step 2: List available JIRA projects
project list_jira_projects
# → Shows table of JIRA projects with keys, names, and leads

# Step 3: User selects appropriate project, then link
project link_jira --projectId "translation_system_20241223_abc123" --jiraProjectKey "TRANS"
# → Creates epic in TRANS project and updates local project
```

### Technical Details

1. **No Assumptions**: System never guesses JIRA project keys
2. **Clear Separation**: Local project creation is independent of JIRA
3. **Explicit Selection**: Users must explicitly choose JIRA project
4. **Epic Support**: Creates epics (not tasks) for project-level tracking

### Files Modified

- `/src/tools/project/unifiedProject.ts` - Added new actions and flow
- `/src/tools/jiraTools.ts` - Added project listing and epic creation
- `/docs/jira-epic-flow.md` - Created comprehensive documentation

### Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users decide which JIRA project to use
2. **Flexibility**: Can create projects without JIRA initially
3. **Transparency**: Clear two-phase workflow
4. **Epic-First**: Projects map to epics, not tasks

### Next Steps

To use this feature:
1. Ensure JIRA credentials are configured in `.env`
2. Create projects using the new flow
3. Use `project list` to see projects with their JIRA epic links

The implementation follows your exact specification where the agent cannot assume the JIRA project and must present options to the user for selection.
