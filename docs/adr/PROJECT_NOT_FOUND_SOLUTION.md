# Project Not Found - Issue Resolved

## The Problem

When you tried to open project `localization_20250531_031122_709`, it failed with:
```
Error in project tool: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Project Doesn't Exist
The project ID `localization_20250531_031122_709` doesn't exist in your current data directory. Your projects folder only contains:
- `jira_persistence_test_20250531_032958_806`
- `market-data-lake-may` (empty folder)

The localization project was likely from:
- A previous chat session
- A different MCP instance
- Or was deleted

### 2. Bug in Error Handling
The code had a bug where it didn't properly check if project properties existed before accessing their length, causing a crash instead of showing a clear error message.

## What I Fixed

### ✅ Fixed the Bug
Updated `projectModel.ts` to safely check properties:
```typescript
// Before (would crash if goals is undefined):
if (project.goals.length > 0)

// After (safely checks):
if (project.goals && project.goals.length > 0)
```

### ✅ Result
Now when you try to open a non-existent project, you get:
```
Project not found: localization_20250531_031122_709
```

Instead of a confusing error about undefined properties.

## To Create a New Localization Project

Since your localization project doesn't exist, you can create a new one:

```bash
project create --name "Localization System" --description "i18n translation management" --tags i18n,localization,translation --category feature
```

Then link it to your JIRA epic:
```bash
project link_jira --projectId "localization_system_[timestamp]" --jiraProjectKey "TT-206"
```

## Summary

1. **Your project wasn't found** because it doesn't exist in the current data directory
2. **The error was confusing** due to a bug in the code
3. **Bug is now fixed** - missing projects show clear "Project not found" messages
4. **You can create a new project** and link it to your JIRA epic TT-206
